                    <p> 
                        I am a 3rd year student at the North West University. 
                        I am currently completing my Bachelors Degree in Information Technology.
                        I am analytical of nature. I aspire to become a business analyst.
                        I enjoy bringing people and technology together.
                        I enjoy rock climbing, squash and painting in my free time.
